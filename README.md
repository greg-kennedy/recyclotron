# recyclotron
Allegro4 game of recycling objects and avoiding trash

This was loosely inspired by the Allego TINS07 game jam, where the theme was "garbage".  In this game you operate a recycling machine and process recyclables as they come off the truck onto conveyor belts.  Higher scores are (intended to be) earned by eating longer chains of identical material.  Garbage bags must be put into the trash truck or they foul the machine, wasting valuable time.

At least, that was the idea - but the mechanics never worked out right and the idea was boring and I gave up.  Enjoy public domain trash truck images.
